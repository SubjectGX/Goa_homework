        <h1>info</h1>
        <p>“Red Constructor” is a Russian documentary film directed by Andrey I and animator Armen Petrosyan.

            The script is based on Thomas Mann's novel “The Magic Mountain” (1924),<br> coupled with the idea of ​​​​creating artificial people in the USSR (in the 1940-1950s).<br> The film uses authentic film documentation from the period 1938-1980, but it is given an extremely free interpretation.</p>

            <p>The film is divided into three chapters and has two storylines, one of which is fiction and the other is documentary.<br>

                In the artistic line, the visual series consists mainly of the same type of frames with hallucinatory content: a red room, a girl in red silk, located in a picture frame, kaleidoscopic images.<br> A female voice-over reads an excerpt from “The Magic Mountain,” in which the thoughts of a deceased soldier are heard (his consciousness still resides in a dead body). There is a reflection on Christ and the Apostles and the interpretation of the word “neighbor/twin”, which occurs in one of the biblical episodes. The soldier's body then becomes a victim of necrophiliac children.

                The documentary part of the film consists of natural filming of operations to transplant toes onto a human hand; short moments from the life of conjoined twins; clippings, possibly a propaganda film for doctors on the use of fibrinolyzed blood in practical medicine, etc.<br> [source not specified 3020 days]
                
                According to the director,<br> “the unique newsreel was bought from a special storage facility for several million rubles”[3], but in fact it was taken from the Department of Scientific and Experimental Medical Cinematography of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, where Khoroshev worked in the 1980s.</p>
